    Site Purpose 
<br>
The purpose of why this site is being built is to show how to build a website to fit multiple platforms.
<br>
The reason that this is an issue to begin with is because in today's world there is hardly on device that is the same as another. Phone, tablets, Laptops and desktops come in many different shapes and sizes. 
<br>
So we must when creating sites fit to any device that is on the market and we start that procces by building wireframes, by scetching out what we want to see and how we want it to fit. 
<br>
One important thing to think of when designing these sites is what is important, for example on a typical desktop you can fit most things that you want on a site but on a tablet or phone you must be able to pick and choose what you believe the most important thing is to the viewer on the screen.

Target Audience
            <br>
            The group that would be using a weather site would be mostly adults, or those who have activites or work that is usually outside. For example, it construction teams would like to know when it was raining or snowing so they could prepare, sports teams would also like to know so they can know if they should cancel their games. 
            <br>
            So mostly you could assume that people who need to know what is happening so that they can prepare if they are outside in whatever thing they are doing.

            Reviewer: Scott Croft
            <br>
            Feedback: He told me that my wireframes were good, but they may lack information and I need to be careful to be sure that im giving all of the available information that is important to my clients.
            <br>
            I changed a few things in my wire frames and made sure that I had a good purpose statement.
