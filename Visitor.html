Visitor Analysis 
<br>
The Target audience for this group would be probably those of about 40 or younger, and mostly in the 1st world, The main group being kids to young adults, This is because the have the most time to view the site and use it.
<br>

I do believe the site meets their needs, the site is there to provide entertainment, waste time, and to be educational. All of which this site provides. They can find videos about just about anything you can think of.
<br>
In the mobile view of youtube, it is very easy to use, on the left you top subscriptions and other things that interest you. On the top of the page you have a search function, and what dominates the page is a videos that are just stacked on top of each other in order of relevance. 
<br>
The mobile site was very easy to use as far as content was concerned, it was very easy to find things and it was easy to navigate. They made the sizing good and the navigation easy to use. 
<br>
The site facilitated very well to mobile users, they did encourage you to get an app, but it works just as well.
